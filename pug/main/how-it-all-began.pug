              In 2021 <a href=#{urls.musicsol}>MusicSOL</a> was born, an online music program that allows anyone to be able to continue taking music lessons, without any risks of infections from the novel COVID-19 virus that began spreading throughout the world.
              Our goal was to allow anyone to take music lessons, regardless of restrictions.

              As time went by, we began seeing a pattern of many parents wanting to give their kids the opportunity to learn music, but just could not afford to do so.
              This is how MusicMi started forming as an idea in our minds. We began talking about it for a few weeks until we decided to go ahead with the idea and open a non-profit organization that would provide scholarships to students with a strong passion for learning.
